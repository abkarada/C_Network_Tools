Network Tools in C
This repository contains a collection of network tools written in C for various network-related tasks such as DNS lookup, WHOIS queries, basic socket programming, and more. These tools are designed to provide a deep understanding of how network communication works at a low level, using raw sockets and custom-built protocols, rather than relying on built-in commands.

Current Features
DNS Lookup: Perform DNS queries to retrieve domain information.
WHOIS Query: Get domain registration information using WHOIS protocol.
Traceroute: Trace the route packets take to reach a destination, similar to the traceroute command.
AXFR: Zone transfer for DNS servers to retrieve domain zone data.
Future Features
This repository will include additional network tools and enhancements, such as:

Nmap-like Scanning Tools: Implementing more advanced scanning features for discovering open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
Advanced Network Protocols: Adding support for more complex protocols and functionality like FTP, HTTP request handling, etc.
Other DNS Functions: Expanding DNS functionalities, including reverse DNS lookups, and more advanced query handling.
