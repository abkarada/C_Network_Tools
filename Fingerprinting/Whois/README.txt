-------------What is whois tool----------------
The WHOIS protocol is a query that checks domain names and IP addresses. Performed on websites like Whois.com and Lookup.icann.org, the WHOIS query reveals the WHOIS data or the identifying and contact information of the researched website. 

You can use the WHOIS system to see if a domain name is registered, who it’s registered to, the owner’s contact details and other helpful registration data on the domain name. Anyone can use the WHOIS service using publicly accessible websites. 

The public WHOIS database stores contact information on everyone who registers a specific domain name or changes their DNS settings. Even though this is not a single, centrally-operated domain name registrar, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) still regulates the entire WHOIS record database.
