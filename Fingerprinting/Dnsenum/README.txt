What is DNS Enumeration?
DNS Enumeration (dnsenum) is a process of gathering DNS records associated with a domain name. This helps in identifying subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other crucial information that can be used for security assessments or network reconnaissance.

Some key record types used in DNS enumeration include:

A Record: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
NS Record: Lists the authoritative name servers for a domain.
MX Record: Identifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails.
CNAME Record: Provides an alias for a domain.
SOA Record: Contains administrative information about a domain.
TXT Record: Holds arbitrary text data used for security and verification.
