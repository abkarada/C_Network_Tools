Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path packets take from one host to another across an IP network. It provides detailed information about the route and the number of hops (intermediate devices such as routers) the packets pass through before reaching their destination. The basic working of traceroute involves sending specially crafted packets and analyzing the responses from each hop.
