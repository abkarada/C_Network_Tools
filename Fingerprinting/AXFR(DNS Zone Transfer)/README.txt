AXFR (Authoritative Zone Transfer) is a DNS protocol used to transfer an entire DNS zone from one DNS server (usually an authoritative DNS server) to another. It allows a secondary DNS server to replicate the DNS records of a domain from a primary DNS server. This is typically used for backup purposes or for synchronizing DNS records across multiple servers.

Here’s the basic flow of AXFR:

Request: A DNS client (usually a secondary server) sends an AXFR request to the authoritative DNS server. The request includes the domain name for which the zone transfer is being requested.

Response: The authoritative DNS server responds with all the DNS records for that domain. The response starts with a Start of Authority (SOA) record, which contains metadata about the zone. After the SOA record, the DNS server sends all the other DNS records (such as A, MX, NS, TXT records).

Transfer Process: The transfer typically uses TCP (instead of UDP) because zone transfers can involve large amounts of data, which might exceed the UDP packet size limit.

Completion: Once the full zone has been transferred, the secondary server stores the data and can start serving requests for the domain.

AXFR allows for a complete copy of a domain’s DNS records to be obtained, ensuring consistency between DNS servers. However, it's often restricted to prevent unauthorized zone transfers for security reasons.
